//1. Create arrow function to calculate average of three values
const calcAverage = (num1, num2, num3) => (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3;

//2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams;
//Data 1:
let avgDolphins = calcAverage(44, 23, 71);
let avgKoalas = calcAverage(65, 54, 49);

//3. Create "checkWinner" function to log the winner to the console together with the victory points. A team only wins if it has at least double the avg score of the other team.
const checkWinner = function (avgDolphins, avgKoalas) {
  if (avgDolphins >= avgKoalas * 2) {
    console.log(`Dolphins win (${avgDolphins} vs. ${avgKoalas})`);
  } else if (avgKoalas >= avgDolphins * 2) {
    console.log(`Koalas win (${avgKoalas} vs. ${avgDolphins})`);
  } else {
    console.log(`There is no winner`);
  }
};

//4. Call "checkWinner" to determine winner
checkWinner(avgDolphins, avgKoalas);

//Using test Data 2
//Data 2;
avgDolphins = calcAverage(85, 54, 41);
avgKoalas = calcAverage(23, 34, 27);
checkWinner(avgDolphins, avgKoalas);
